Ship Level
The upper/lower climber timer
"Fridge logic"
Move "2 entrance tango" up a rating and make 100%. Maybe reduce skillset. Move four lemming fiesta down.
Fix Icho's backroutes in High Moon & Bolt From The Blue
Set RR to 83 and move resonant frequency to rating 1 as level 2 - climber intro. Maybe add some decoration to make it look a little nicer.


Maybe:
------
Fix for Higgs Boson? (Maybe)
Rework Sleepwalker? (Maybe)
